    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to manage user accounts and associated data related to student internships and graduation processes. It emphasizes authorization independence through path-based ownership and explicit role assignments. The structure segregates different types of data into distinct collections to simplify security rules and ensure secure list operations (QAPs). Specifically, UserAccounts, Students and Supervisors are stored at the root level. Roles will be checked based on user authentication and the role field in the user document. This approach avoids complex `get()` calls in security rules and ensures atomic operations and simpler debugging.\n\nThis structure achieves Authorization Independence by relying on path-based ownership for user data (students, supervisors), avoiding the need to fetch parent document data to authorize access. The QAPs are supported by segregating data based on user roles and ownership using the directory-like structure."
