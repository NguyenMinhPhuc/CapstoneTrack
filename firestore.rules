/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CapstoneTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model, where users can only access
 * and modify data according to their assigned role (admin, supervisor, student). User
 * accounts are stored under /users/{userId}, with additional student and supervisor
 * details stored in separate collections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information, including role (admin, supervisor, student).
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student details.
 * - /supervisors/{supervisorId}: Stores supervisor details.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Administrators have full read/write access to all data.
 * - Students and supervisors can only read their own data.
 * - Listing of users is denied to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
 * - Self-creation of user accounts is allowed, but only with a matching user ID.
 * - No data validation is enforced beyond authorization checks in this prototype.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The user's role is stored directly in the /users/{userId} document to allow for easy
 *    role-based access control without additional reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - User account information is separated from student and supervisor details to allow
 *    for different access control policies.
