/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CapstoneTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles (users, students, supervisors).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information, with {userId} matching the Firebase Authentication UID.
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student-specific data.
 * - /supervisors/{supervisorId}: Stores supervisor-specific data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of all users, students, and supervisors is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - All write operations are protected by authorization checks based on the authenticated user's UID.
 * - The 'id' field in each document is used as the ownership field and is immutable after creation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - UserAccount documents are stored at `/users/{userId}`, where {userId} corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 *   This denormalization avoids the need for complex `get()` operations to determine user identity.
