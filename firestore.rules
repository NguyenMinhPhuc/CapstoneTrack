/**
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user accounts,
 *              students, and supervisors, with additional restrictions on listing user accounts.
 *              It prioritizes security and data isolation.
 * @dataStructure
 *  - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information, accessible only by the user and admins.
 *  - /students/{studentId}: Stores student information, accessible only by the student and admins.
 *  - /supervisors/{supervisorId}: Stores supervisor information, accessible only by the supervisor and admins.
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 *  - User accounts are not listable by regular users to prevent enumeration.
 *  - Students and supervisors can only access their own data.
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization N/A - No denormalization is needed in this simple model.
 * @structuralSegregation N/A - Drafts vs. published content is not applicable here.
