/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CapstoneTrack application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset implements a hybrid security model, balancing open access for public
 * content with strict ownership and role-based access control for user-specific data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information; access restricted to the owner.
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student details; publicly readable, owner-writable (if the user owns the studentId).
 * - /supervisors/{supervisorId}: Stores supervisor details; publicly readable, owner-writable (if the user owns the supervisorId).
 * - /graduationDefenseSessions/{sessionId}: Stores graduation defense session information; publicly readable, writes not implemented (TODO).
 * - /graduationDefenseSessions/{sessionId}/registrations/{registrationId}: Stores student registrations for defense sessions. Students can create their own registrations.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own user account data.
 * - Students and supervisors profiles are readable by all, but only writable by their owners.
 * - Listing users is disallowed.
 * - GraduationDefenseSessions are publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The student registration documents does not contain the sessionId. The ID of the parent document `graduationDefenseSessions` is used to secure access.
