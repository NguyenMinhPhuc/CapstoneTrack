/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the `users`, `students`, and `supervisors` collections.
 * Only authenticated users can access their own data.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user account information, with {userId} matching the Firebase Authentication UID.
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles.
 * - /supervisors/{supervisorId}: Stores supervisor profiles.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Listing of all users, students, and supervisors is explicitly denied to prevent information leakage.
 * - All write operations are restricted to authenticated users and must pass ownership validation.
 *
 * @authorizationDenormalization
 *  - User roles are denormalized within the `/users/{userId}` document to simplify authorization checks and avoid costly `get()` operations.
